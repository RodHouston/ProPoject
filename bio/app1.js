" Being a military spouse requires constant movement to different locations, both overseas and across the United States. Roderick has had the opportunity to experience cultures in Italy and Guam, as well as live in Florida, a short return to Oklahoma and now resides in northern Virginia. While these experiences are rare for most, this constant state of movement has required Roderick to take on many careers. After much thought and research, he decided to pursue a career as a software engineer, for more stability with its opportunities for remote work.", "  Roderick truly enjoys a challenge and the complexity that comes with coding. His creativity is beyond reproach and would be an asset on any development team. Roderickâ€™s plan is to work his way through the industry, gaining experience in developing web and mobile applications. His ultimate goal is to do software development with the automotive industry such as mobile device connectivity and digital vehicle interfaces. "]
